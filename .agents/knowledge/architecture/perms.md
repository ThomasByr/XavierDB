# Architecture — Permissions

_Split from the former `knowledge/architecture.md` (2026-08-24); section map in `knowledge/architecture/README.md`._

## 2. Permissions (`authorized_keys.yml`)

- Structure: `apps: {app_id: {token_hash, allow: [rules], deny: [rules], names:
  {name: {allow, deny}}}}`. Rule = `{actions, databases, collections}`.
  Globs `*` and `?`. Actions = HTTP verbs `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE` **plus
  `INDEX`** (manage indexes on /q/{db}/{coll}/indexes — default-deny, a
  schema-level capability separate from document writes). Template:
  `authorized_keys.yml.example`.
- **Layered, first-match-wins**: name.deny → name.allow → app.deny →
  app.allow → deny.
- New names are auto-added to the yml on `/auth` — this rewrites the whole
  file (reformatted, comments lost, same as dashboard saves); permission file
  hot-reloads.
- Client path perms are re-checked live on EVERY `/q/` request. Apps with no
  rules inherit nothing — they get the layered defaults.
- Dashboard rewrites of the file **lose comments** (known limit).
- Watcher loss window (known limit): an external hand-edit of
  authorized_keys.yml or the config file can be silently lost if the server
  writes its own copy within the ~500 ms watcher debounce (the self-write
  byte-stamp then suppresses the reload).
